# Story 1.6: Logging & Diagnostics Framework

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** structured logging using OSLog with privacy controls,
**so that** I can debug issues while respecting user privacy.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Logging utility created wrapping `OSLog` with predefined subsystems/categories
2. Log levels defined: debug, info, notice, error, fault
3. Privacy levels used: public (non-sensitive), private (sensitive), sensitive (redacted in logs)
4. Example log statements added to app launch flow demonstrating usage
5. Diagnostics export function created (collects logs, system info, sanitizes sensitive data)
6. User-initiated diagnostics export accessible via Settings (returns `.zip` file)
7. No logs written to files by default (uses OS logging system)

  - [ ] Sanitize sensitive data before export
  - [ ] Create diagnostic report format (JSON or text)
- [ ] Implement user-facing diagnostics export (AC: 6)

  - [ ] Confirm logs only use OSLog system
  - [ ] Verify no logs written to app directory
  - [ ] Document that logs are stored by macOS in system location
  - [ ] Document how users can view logs in Console.app

## Dev Notes

### Logging Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Logging:** OSLog
- **Purpose:** On-device logging
- **Features:** Privacy-preserving, user-controlled export

### Monitoring and Observability Strategy
[Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md]

**Logging Strategy:**
- Use OSLog for all logging (not print() or NSLog)
- Structured logging with subsystems and categories
- Proper privacy annotations for sensitive data
- No custom log files (use system logging)

**Subsystem:** `com.yourcompany.mytoob`

**Categories:**
- `app` - Application lifecycle events
- `network` - Network requests and responses
- `ai` - AI/ML operations
- `player` - Video playback events
- `sync` - CloudKit synchronization
- `ui` - User interface events

**Log Levels:**
- `debug` - Detailed information for debugging (not in production logs)
- `info` - Informational messages
- `notice` - Important but not error conditions
- `error` - Error conditions that don't crash app
- `fault` - Critical errors that may crash app

### File Location
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Logging service: `MyToob/Core/Utilities/LoggingService.swift`

### Coding Standards for Logging
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Always use structured logging (OSLog), never print() statements
- Use appropriate privacy levels for all logged data
- Use proper log categories for filtering

### Privacy Levels
**Public (non-sensitive):**
- App version, build number
- Non-user-specific events (app launched, feature used)
- Error codes and types

**Private (sensitive, visible to developers):**
- Video IDs, titles
- Cluster labels
- Search queries

**Sensitive (redacted from logs):**
- User tokens, API keys
- File paths containing usernames
- Any personally identifiable information

### Implementation Example
```swift
import OSLog

final class LoggingService {
    static let shared = LoggingService()

    private let subsystem = "com.yourcompany.mytoob"

    let app: Logger
    let network: Logger
    let ai: Logger
    let player: Logger

    private init() {
        app = Logger(subsystem: subsystem, category: "app")
        network = Logger(subsystem: subsystem, category: "network")
        ai = Logger(subsystem: subsystem, category: "ai")
        player = Logger(subsystem: subsystem, category: "player")
    }

    // Example usage:
    // LoggingService.shared.app.info("App launched, version: \(appVersion)")
    // LoggingService.shared.network.error("API request failed: \(error, privacy: .public)")
    // LoggingService.shared.player.debug("Playing video: \(videoID, privacy: .private)")
}
```

### Diagnostics Export
User-initiated diagnostics should include:
- Recent OSLog entries (last 24 hours or user-specified)
- App version and build number
- macOS version
- Device model
- ModelContainer statistics (number of videos, clusters, etc.)
- Any crash reports if available

Sanitization requirements:
- Redact API keys and tokens
- Redact user file paths
- Keep error messages and stack traces
- Keep anonymized metrics

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Location:** `MyToobTests/Utilities/`
- **Test Framework:** XCTest

### Testing Requirements for This Story
**Unit Tests:**
- Create `MyToobTests/Utilities/LoggingServiceTests.swift`
- Test: Logging service initializes correctly
- Test: Each log category is accessible
- Test: Log methods can be called without errors
- Test: Privacy levels work as expected

**Integration Tests:**
- Test: Diagnostics export creates valid .zip file
- Test: Diagnostics export sanitizes sensitive data
- Test: Diagnostics export includes expected sections
- Test: Log entries appear in Console.app during development

**Manual Testing:**
1. Run app and check Console.app for log entries
2. Filter logs by subsystem "com.yourcompany.mytoob"
3. Verify different log levels appear correctly
4. Verify privacy redaction works
5. Export diagnostics from Settings
6. Open exported .zip and verify contents
7. Verify sensitive data is not in export
