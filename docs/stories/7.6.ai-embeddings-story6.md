# Story 7.6: AI Embeddings & Vector Index Story 6

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer/user,
**I want** on-device AI embeddings and vector search,
**so that** semantic search is fast and privacy-preserving.

## Acceptance Criteria
_See Epic 7 document for full AC list for story 7.6_

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement per Epic 7 Story 7.6 requirements
- [ ] Core ML model integration
- [ ] Vector index (HNSW) implementation
- [ ] Embedding generation pipeline
- [ ] Create tests

## Dev Notes
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/component-architecture.md]
- Core ML: sentence-transformer-384.mlpackage (8-bit quantized)
- HNSW index: M=16, ef_search=100
- Target: <10ms inference, <50ms search
- Files: MyToob/Features/AI/

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests for embedding generation
- Performance tests for search latency
- Test with various input text
